# What is Endcoin? 

Endcoin is a new cryptocurrancy whose emmision rate and subsequent value is derived from climate data. 

We track the global average sea surface temperature and use this datapoint to control the emission rate of the token. 

Endcoin has a partner, Gaiacoin, and together they provide an initial pool of liquidity. 

# Endcoin - Short the world
Endcoins emmisions drop as the worlds sea temperatures rise to 35 degrees, providing scarcity as the world heats up. 
Holders of Endcoin are betting against the world, and will expect their assets to grow in value as the planet declines and slowly dies. 

# Gaiacoin - Long the world
Gaiacoin is directly inversed to Endcoin. As the temperature rises, more Gaiacoins are emmited. By investing in climate projects, humans can "long the world" and bring temperatures back under control. As we regain control of our planets ecosystem, we increase our value. 

# Bubbledome
Endcoin and gaiacoin holders will be awarded with a ticket to the Bubbledome: A safe haven that will be created when the world has declined to dust. The bubble dome will be the last city left on planet earth, and only holders of tickets will be allowed access.
